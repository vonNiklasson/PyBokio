## Usage

### Connecting

#### Connecting with credentials

The simplest way to connect with the client is through credentials.

```python
from pybokio import BokioClient

client = BokioClient(
    company_id="00000000-0000-4000-0000-000000000000",
    username="your@email.here",
    password="your.password"
)
client.connect()
```

#### Connecting with cookiejar

A preferred way to connect is to reuse the session after logging in with credentials.

**Saving cookies from an existing session**

```python
import pickle
...

cookies = client.get_cookiejar()
with open('session.pickle', 'wb') as f:
    pickle.dump(cookies, f)
```

**Reusing cookies to connect again**

```python
from pybokio import BokioClient
import pickle

with open('session.pickle') as f:
    cookies = pickle.load(f)

client = BokioClient.from_cookiejar(
    company_id="00000000-0000-4000-0000-000000000000",
    cookiejar=cookies
)
client.connect()
```
